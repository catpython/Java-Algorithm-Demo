LinkedList_vs _BTree

do not use any classes from java.util.*. Write any classes you need on your own. You may, however, use classes from java.lang.*.

1)	Assume you need a linked list of integers that is always sorted, and which could be of any length. For example,

5, 7, 11, 20, 27, 36, 36, 54

Write a Java class (or classes) to implement this collection and a method to insert new values so that the collection is always sorted. The collection can contain duplicate values.

2)	Override the toString() method of your class to return the contents of the list as a simple String.

3)	Write a main() method to test your class and demonstrate that it works.

4)	Express the complexity of your answers to questions 1 and 2 in Big O Notation.

5)	Reimplement the class from questions 1 and 2 as a binary tree. The insert() method should place new nodes into the tree so that the tree can be traversed in numerical order. The tree does not need to represent duplicate values.

The toString() method should return a String representing the nodes as a list in numerical order.

6)	Write a main() method to test your class and demonstrate that it works.

7)	Express the complexity of the insert() and toString() methods in question 5 in Big O Notation.

8)	Assume that you need a collection that has a ratio of inserts to searches of 1:100. Use Big O Notation to determine whether a linked list or a binary tree would be the best solution under average circumstances. Show your work (i.e. do the math).
